# ARFM-analysis
Skills used: Inner, left and right join, views, case, partition
This is an implementation of the classic RFM analysis adding a parameter: activity. 
It measures how much the customer uses the platform of the e-commerce, therefore its activity. In this case the customers are agencies. 
The overall categories are 5 to semplify the marketing strategy resulting from the analysis. 
I performed the analysis year by year and then joined the results.
